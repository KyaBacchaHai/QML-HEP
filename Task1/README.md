## Task 1

1) Implement a simple quantum operation with Cirq
	- With 5 qubits
	- Apply Hadamard operation on every qubit
	- Apply CNOT operation on (0, 1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4)
	- SWAP (0, 4)
	- Rotate X with pi/2 on any qubit
	- Plot the circuit
	
2) Create a circuit that is a series of small cirq.Rx rotations and plot the probability of measuring the state in the |0‚ü© state.
